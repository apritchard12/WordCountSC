1. clone project to your machine
2. mvn package

Run with arguments: inputDirectory, stopWordsDirectory/file.txt, outputDirectory
3. mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.Main" -Dexec.args="/project/email /project/src/main/resources/stopWords /Users/output"


Important* By default the word count program will expect the enron directory structure.  So just add /file/path/maildir/

The program itself will add in the /*/*/*. to load all of the emails.


**Stop words have been included and are located in:  src/main/resources/stopWords

Unit tests do run and read sample input data, and also subtract any stop words.
